In Prolog, two terms are unifiable if they can be made equivalent through variable substitution. Let's analyze each of the given pairs of terms to determine if they are unifiable:

X and f(a,b): Unifiable. You can unify X with f(a, b) by setting X = f(a, b).

f(X,a) and g(X,a): Not unifiable. The predicates have different names (f and g) and cannot be unified.

3 and 2+1: Unifiable. You can unify 3 with 2+1 by setting 3 = 2+1.

book(X,1) and book(Z): Unifiable. You can unify book(X, 1) with book(Z) by setting X = Z and ignoring the 1 since it's a constant.

likes(jax,X) and likes(X,jax): Unifiable. You can unify likes(jax, X) with likes(X, jax) by setting X = jax.

food(X,Y,Z) and food(M,M,M): Unifiable. You can unify food(X,Y,Z) with food(M,M,M) by setting X = M, Y = M, and Z = M.

[a,b,c,[d,a],[1,2],list] and [X | Y]: Unifiable. You can unify [a,b,c,[d,a],[1,2],list] with [X | Y] by setting X = a and Y = [b,c,[d,a],[1,2],list].

[a,b,X] and [Y | [3,4]]: Unifiable. You can unify [a,b,X] with [Y | [3,4]] by setting X = [3,4] and Y = a, b.

X(a,b) and f(Z,Y): Unifiable. You can unify X(a,b) with f(Z,Y) by setting X = f(Z,Y).

[X | [Y | T]] and [1,2,3,4]: Unifiable. You can unify [X | [Y | T]] with [1,2,3,4] by setting X = 1, Y = 2, and T = [3,4].

[X,Y | Z] and [a,b,c,d]: Not unifiable. The lengths of the lists are different, and there's no way to unify them.

So, the unifiable pairs are 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. The pairs 2 and 11 are not unifiable.
